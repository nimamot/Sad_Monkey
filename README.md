# Sad Monkey 

## My personal Java project for CPSC210

#### Sad Monkey is a simple market place for NFTs where you can list your own collection, purchase from other collections and trade NFTs. The aaplication will be similar to services such as *OpenSea* and *Binance NFTs Market place*. Just like any other NFT Market place, you can see the history of each NFT listed on Sad Monkey. In order to purchase an NFT or receive payments, you need to transfer SOL/ETH/BTC/BNB from your preffered wallet to your Sad Monkey account.

## **Features**:
