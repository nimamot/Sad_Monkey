# Sad Monkey NFT Marketplace

## My personal Java project for CPSC 210

#### Sad Monkey is a simple marketplace for NFTs where you can list your own collection, purchase from other collections and trade NFTs. The application will be similar to services such as *OpenSea* and *Binance NFTs Marketplace*. In order to purchase an NFT or receive payments, you need to transfer assets from your preferred wallet to your Sad Monkey account. I have chosen this project because I believe non-fungible tokens will play a big part in the digital world.

## **Features**:
- #### List your NFTs 
- #### Purchase NFTs
- #### Transfer assets To your MetaMask wallet
- #### View your Wallet
